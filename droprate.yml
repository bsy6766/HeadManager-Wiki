# This yml manages head drop, drop effect, and drop rate
# All setttings ends with "_droprate" must be between 0.0 and 100.0
#
# For enchant bonus and base rate
# You can raise the number as much as you want. 
# But it can cause 100% droprate for well enchanted tool or weapon.
#
# Droprate equation
#
# Final droprate = (base_rate + SUM(enchant_bonus * enchantment level / 100)) 
#					* droprate(entity, block, etc);
# Ex) Scenario: Killed zombie with unbreaking 3 and sharpness 5 diamond sword,
#				with zombie_droprate: 0.1, unbreaking_bonus: 10.0, 
#				sharpness_bonus: 20.0, base_rate: 0 
#		Final Zombie head droprate
#			= (0 + (10 * 3 / 100) + (20 * 5 / 100)) * 0.1
#			= (0 + 0.3 + 1) * 0.1
#			= 1.3 * 0.1
#			= 0.13 (Raised from 0.1)
#		
#		What's the difference between 0.13 and 0.1?
#	 		Even the amount of the number raised with enchant bonus is low,
#			it actually changes the total amount of head drop a lot.
