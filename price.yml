# Price.yml
#
# Each tab and each head on head shop can have specific price on both purchase and return.
# You will see each tab name and two child node called "purchase" and "return". 
# Each responses for purchase price and return price of the heads in the specific tab. 
# In "purchase" node, you will see "basePrice" and "variable" node. 
# "basePrice" node will be the base price of heads in the corresponding tab. 
# "variable" node will be the place where you can explicitly set the additional(Can be negative value, but total head price can't go below 0) price of specific head
# For instance, if you set "Food" tab's "basePrice" to 5000 and set some arbitrary head's price (let's say 'Apple') to 500, then Apple's price for purchase will be 5500. \
# Works same with "return" node, which will be return cost.
# In game, you can check head price on head item's lore.
# Heads that are once purchased or obtained will keep the price even you change price.yml because price will be signed in head item's data.
# Heads that were purchased and obtained before this update will have return cost of 0. 
# For dropped heads, check "drop" node in price.yml to set the price. 
# To prevent player farming money by selling heads, set this to 0. 
# Head name node must match the head's name. (ie. "Blue Wool" head matches "Blue Wool" node, but not with "BlueWool")
